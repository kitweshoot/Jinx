# Jinx: Virtual Real Estate Platform for the Metaverse

Welcome to **Jinx**, a decentralized platform where users can buy, sell, and develop NFT-based land parcels in the metaverse. Built on the **Stacks blockchain**, Jinx leverages **Clarity smart contracts** to manage ownership, transactions, and the development of virtual land parcels. This README outlines the functionality, smart contracts, and steps to interact with the Jinx platform.

## Overview

**Jinx** is a decentralized platform that enables users to own, buy, sell, and develop digital land in a metaverse using **NFTs** (Non-Fungible Tokens). Each land parcel is represented as an NFT that can be bought, sold, and developed. Users can build on their parcels, improve them, or even monetize their virtual real estate. The platform uses **Clarity** smart contracts on the **Stacks blockchain** to manage transactions, land ownership, royalties, and platform fees.

---

## Features

* **Land Ownership**: Land parcels are represented as NFTs, where each parcel has unique metadata (e.g., size, coordinates, title, owner).
* **Marketplace**: Users can list their land for sale at a specified price or auction it to the highest bidder.
* **Land Development**: Owners can develop their land by adding improvements, buildings, and other enhancements.
* **Royalties**: Creators and developers of land can earn royalties when their land is sold or resold on the platform.
* **Auction System**: Users can participate in virtual land auctions and place bids to acquire rare land parcels.
* **User Profiles**: Users can create profiles to track their land holdings, transaction history, and other assets.
* **Governance**: Platform-wide decisions, such as policy changes, are made through decentralized governance.
* **Escrow Services**: Secure transactions with escrow services during land purchases and sales.

## Smart Contracts

The **Clarity smart contracts** below facilitate the core functionality of the Jinx platform, including land ownership, marketplace transactions, land development, and platform governance.

### 1. **Land Ownership Contract**

**Purpose:** Manages the ownership of digital land parcels as NFTs.

**Key Functions:**

* `mint-land`: Mints a new land parcel and assigns ownership to the user.
* `transfer-land`: Facilitates the transfer of ownership of a land parcel to a new owner.
* `get-owner`: Retrieves the current owner of a given land parcel.
* `get-land-metadata`: Retrieves metadata (e.g., coordinates, size, title) of a land parcel.

### 2. **Marketplace Listing Contract**

**Purpose:** Allows users to list their land parcels for sale on the marketplace.

**Key Functions:**

* `list-land`: Lists a land parcel for sale at a specific price.
* `update-listing`: Updates the sale price of a listed land parcel.
* `delist-land`: Removes a land parcel from the marketplace.
* `get-listing`: Retrieves the details of a specific land listing.

### 3. **Marketplace Buying Contract**

**Purpose:** Manages the process of purchasing land from the marketplace.

**Key Functions:**

* `buy-land`: Facilitates the purchase of a listed land parcel.
* `get-land-price`: Retrieves the sale price of a listed land parcel.
* `refund`: Handles refunds in case of failed transactions or disputes.

### 4. **Land Development Contract**

**Purpose:** Allows landowners to develop their land by adding enhancements (buildings, utilities, etc.).

**Key Functions:**

* `develop-land`: Adds new developments or improvements to a land parcel.
* `get-developments`: Retrieves the list of improvements or developments on a land parcel.
* `remove-development`: Removes a development from a land parcel.

### 5. **Land Improvements Contract**

**Purpose:** Facilitates the addition of improvements or upgrades to a land parcel (e.g., buildings, infrastructure).

**Key Functions:**

* `add-improvement`: Adds an improvement to a land parcel.
* `remove-improvement`: Removes an improvement from a land parcel.
* `get-improvements`: Retrieves a list of all improvements on a land parcel.

### 6. **Royalty Management Contract**

**Purpose:** Ensures that creators and developers receive royalties when land is resold.

**Key Functions:**

* `set-royalty`: Allows creators to set a royalty percentage on resales.
* `pay-royalty`: Automatically transfers royalties to the creator when the land is sold or resold.
* `get-royalty`: Retrieves the royalty percentage for a specific land parcel.

### 7. **User Profile Contract**

**Purpose:** Manages user profiles, including land holdings and transaction history.

## Installation

To deploy and interact with **Jinx**, you’ll need the following tools:

### Prerequisites

1. **Stacks CLI**: For deploying smart contracts to the Stacks blockchain.
2. **Clarity Language**: The smart contract language used for writing the contracts.
3. **Stacks Testnet**: For testing the contracts before deployment to the mainnet.
4. **Node.js and NPM**: For running scripts and managing the backend.

```bash
# Install Stacks CLI
curl -fsSL https://stacks.co/install.sh | bash

# Install Node.js (if not already installed)
sudo apt install nodejs

# Install npm (if not already installed)
sudo apt install npm
```

---

## Deployment

### Deploying Smart Contracts

1. Write your **Clarity smart contracts** in `.clar` files.
2. Use the **Stacks CLI** to deploy the contracts to either the **Stacks Testnet** or **Mainnet**.

   ```bash
   stacks deploy contract <contract-file> --network testnet
   ```

### Deploying the Frontend

Jinx’s frontend can be deployed using traditional web deployment tools like **GitHub Pages**, **Vercel**, or **Netlify**. The frontend will interact with the deployed smart contracts using **Stacks.js** for wallet integration and transactions.

---

## Usage

Once deployed, users can interact with **Jinx** through the frontend interface to:

* **Buy Land**: Browse available land parcels and purchase them.
* **Sell Land**: List your land for sale on the marketplace or auction.
* **Develop Land**: Improve your land with new developments and infrastructure.
* **Track Transactions**: View your land holdings and transaction history in your user profile.
* **Participate in Auctions**: Place bids on land auctions for exclusive or rare parcels.
